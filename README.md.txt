## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
-It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
-A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
-Training accuracy steadily improves, indicating the model is learning patterns from the training data.
-Training loss consistently decreases, showing that the optimization process is functioning correctly.
-Validation accuracy reaches a decent level at times, suggesting that the model can generalize under certain conditions.
-Augmentation and class balancing have likely contributed to the model's ability to learn diverse features
